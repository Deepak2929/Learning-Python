(1.STARTING TO CODE)
GUESS_GAME
This code is a guessing-game program.The program keep asking the user for an answer while the current
guess is wrong.The correct answer in the program is a random number and it should be different each time
you play the game.The program stops when you get the answer right.


PROGRAMMING TOOLS:
* Programs are created from code statements:
-commands do things.
-branches decide things.
-loops repeat things.
* Conditionals help you decide if
  something is True or False.
* Assignment sets a name to a value.
* A named value is stored in a “variable”.


PYTHON TOOLS:
* if/else branches
* while loops
* = assignment operator
* == equality operator
* != inequality operator
*  '>' greater than operator
* print() displays a message on screen
* input() gets and returns user input
* int() converts characters to numbers
* randint() produces a random number

(2. Textual Data' STRINGS')
The program extract the price starting at any dynamic position in Html page.

There are many string methods that can help you search,copy,append for a substring within a string object.
We also get to know about datatype. If two pieces of data are different types, we can’t compare them to each other.
Uses the time library to send requests every 15 minutes or so, which should help to lighten the load.

Programming Tools
* Strings are sequences of individual characters.
* Individual string characters are referenced by index.
* Index values are offsets that start from zero.
* Methods provide variables with built-in functionality.
* Programming libraries provide a collection of related
pre-built code and functions.
* As well as having a value, data in variables also have a
“data type."
* Number is a data type.
* String is a data type.




Python Tools
* s[4] - access the 5th character of the variable “s",
which is a string
* s[6:12] - access a sub-string within the string “s" (up
to, but not including)
*s.find() method for searching strings
* s.upper() method for converting strings to
UPPERCASE
* float() converts strings to decimal point numbers
known as “floats"
* + addition operator
* '>' greater than operator
* urllib.request library for talking to the Web
* time library for working with dates/time
